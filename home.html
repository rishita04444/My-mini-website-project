            <p>Your skin acts as a barrier to our internal systems that are imperative to our health and well-being. Taking steps to properly care for our skin helps to ensure this important barrier is strong. When the skin is dry or irritated, cracks can occur, which make you more prone to infection.<br><br>

                Your skin also plays a vital role in protecting you from the sun and it’s harmful rays. That’s why sunscreen is recommended for adults and kids to wear daily. After all, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer and can occur in people of all ages.</p>

            <p>Who doesn’t enjoy looking their best? It’s important to take care of your skin as it helps it look more youthful. As you age, your skin cells regenerate less frequently, which means your skin can start to show signs of aging and lose that jovial radiance.<br><br>

                Using high-quality skin care and having skin treatments such as facials help promote clear and glowing skin. When you use good skin care products, you remove dead skin cells that regenerate into new cells that have you looking and feeling your best.</p>

            <p>Taking preventive measures with a well-thought-out skin care routine is essential to long-term skin health. This can help you avoid the development of certain conditions and signs of aging, as well as reduce the severity of problems you may already be dealing with.<br><br>

                For many years, people believed that prioritizing a consistent skin care regimen with high-quality products was only intended for those with sensitive skin. Not even close. Preventive skin care is for everyone.

                Here are four tips on how to practice proper skin care and prioritize the importance of skin care in your daily life.

            <h3>Using Correct Face-Washing Technique</h3>
        </div>
        <br><br>

        <div class="te">
            <p>While you might be thinking, if you’re washing your face, that should be good enough. And while that’s a start, how you wash your face can play a role in not only how it feels and looks, but also what’s happening underneath the skin.<br><br>
                 That’s why practicing proper face-washing technique is essential. The American Academy of Dermatology Association recommends washing your face no more than twice a day. That said, once a day will suffice for some.
